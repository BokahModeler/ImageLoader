# Pushing back to github
  Once code is written up that you are satisfied with, you will want to push changes.
  
  1. gitbash into eclipse workspace
  2. cd into imageloader
  3. gitbash should show that this is the master branch, this is what we want.
  4. git add <src folder> (Lets git know what it is you are changing)
  5. git commit -m "Insert MEANINGFUL comment here" (for organization in updates)
  6. git push
  
Note: This will merge with the master branch. If MAJOR changes are being done that could break with someone else, play around with forking into your personal directories etc.
